\end{marginfigure}
Consider an finite, directed multigraph $G=(V,E)$ without self-loops, as in
Fig.~1.
We will understand $G$ as the hyperlink structure of the web pages
described by $V$; an arc from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ describes a
hyperlink from page $u$ to page $v$.

The \emph{random surfer} model is a stochastic process that aims to
rank the relevance of a these pages.
The states of this process are the vertices $V$.
With good probability $\alpha$, the process picks an outgoing edge at
random and moves to that page.
If there are no outgoing edges, the surfer picks a random page from
$V$ instead.
(Note that outgoing edges are counted with multiplicities, so from
vertex~0 in the example, the chance of going to 1 is twice that of
going to 2.)
Alternatively, with probability $(1-\alpha)$, the surfer becomes bored
and moves to a random page from $V$ instead.
The probability $\alpha$ is called the \emph{damping factor}; a
typically value that works well for web pages is $\alpha = \frac{85}{100}$. 

This process is a finite, irreducible, and ergodic Markov chain.
Its stationary distribution describes the \emph{page rank} of each
vertex. The contribution of Sergey Brin and Larry Page was to
realise that this value gives a good measure of the relevance of a web
page, which is the main idea behind the search engine
Google.

\subsection{Deliverables}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement a simulation of the random surfer model. 
  Start in
  vertex 0 and follow the rules for a given number of iterations read
  from the command line. Count the number of times each vertex is
  visited and print the relative frequencies.
\item Solve the exact same problem using linear algebra instead of
  simulation.
  That is, construct the transition probability matrix $P$ and
  compute $pP^r$ for some sufficiently high $r$ (read from the command
  line) and some initial row vector $p$ of your choice.
  In fact, we're approximating the dominant left eigenvector, i.e., a
  vector satisfying $pP= p$.
  There are (at least) 3 ways of computing $pP^r$:
  \begin{enumerate} 
  \item Let $p_0= p$. For each $i=1,\ldots, r$ let $p_i = p_{i-1}
    P$. Return $p_r$.
  \item Compute $Q = P^r = P\cdot P \cdots P$ using $r-1$ matrix products.
    Return $pQ$.
  \item Compute $P^r$ by iterated squaring. Assume $r$ is a power of
    2. Set $Q_0 = P$ and for $i=1,\ldots,\log r$ compute $Q_i =
    Q_{i-1}^2$. Return $pQ_{\log r}$. 
  \end{enumerate}
  Pick the one you think is fastest or easiest to implement for the
  small instances.

  However, to attack an instance of nontrivial size, you need to
  exploit the structure of the transition matrix.
  (Unless you like waiting a lot.)
  Let $A$ denote the adjacency matrix of $G$, and define the two
  matrices
  \[
  H_{ij} =
  \begin{cases}
    A_{ij} / \deg(i)\,, & \text{if } \deg(i) > 0\,; \\
    0\,, & \text{if } \deg(i) = 0 \,;   
  \end{cases}
  \]
  and
  \[
  D_{ij} =
  \begin{cases}
    0\,, & \text{if } \deg(i) > 0\,; \\
    1 / n\,, & \text{if } \deg(i) = 0\,.
  \end{cases}
  \]
  Then,
  \[ P = \alpha(H + D) + \frac{1-\alpha}{n} \bf 1\,,\]
  where $\bf 1$ is the $|V|\times |V|$ all-1s matrix.
  In particular,
  \[pP = \alpha p H + \alpha p D + \frac{1-\alpha}{n} p \bf 1\,.\] All
  three of these vector--matrix products are simpler to compute: all
  columns in $D$ are identical, all columns in $\bf 1$ are identical,
  and $H$ is sparse (so you don't store is as a square matrix of size
  $O(|V|^2)$; just as a list of $O(|E|)$ nonzero values).
  Oh, and if you really just wrote code to compute the product
  between $p$ and an all-1s matrix, this is a good time for a break.
\item Fill out the report.

\subsection{Transition probabilities}

The transition matrix for the graph described in three.txt
is
\begin{equation*}
P = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
0.0375    &  0.60416667&  0.32083333&  0.0375   \\
0.0375    &  0.0375    &  0.8875    &  0.0375    \\
0.32083333&  0.32083333&  0.0375    &  0.32083333\\
0.25      &  0.25      &  0.25      &  0.25      
\end{array}
\right)\,,
\end{equation*}
and its 10th power is
\begin{equation*}
P^{10} = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
0.0375    &  0.60416667&  0.32083333&  0.0375   \\
0.0375    &  0.0375    &  0.8875    &  0.0375    \\
0.32083333&  0.32083333&  0.0375    &  0.32083333\\
0.25      &  0.25      &  0.25      &  0.25      
\end{array}
\right)\,.
\end{equation*}

The transition matrix $P$ can be broken down into  $P = \alpha(H + D)
+ \frac{1-\alpha}{n} \bf 1$, where
\begin{equation*}
H = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
0    &  2/3 & 1/3 &  0\\
0    &  0    &  1    &  0\\
1/3 & 1/3 &  0    &  1/3\\
0      &  0 &  0      &  0      
\end{array}
\right)\,.
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
D = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25 & 0.25
\end{array}
\right)\,.
\end{equation*}
