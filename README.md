# Repository for EDAN55 -- Advanced algorithms.

Will post individual README's in each laboration folder.

### Project uses:
  * Python (3.x) as its main language.
  * git + github for code sharing / revisioning.
  * LaTeX for report generation.

### Branching strategies:
  * Main development on branch `dev`.
  * Commits on `master` should be ready for hand-in.
  * Individual branches for experimentation etc. is highly encouraged!
